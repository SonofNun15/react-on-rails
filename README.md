## react-rails-es6

This branch uses the `react-rails` gem to render some simple ReactJS components within a Rails application. It also includes `sprockets` and `babel-transpiler` to transpile ES6 code.

## react-on-rails
A vanilla Ruby on Rails application for tracking vehicle mileage

Runs great on Ruby 2.2.2

To run, execute:
```
bundle
bundle exec rake db:setup
bundle exec rails s
```

Then point a browser to `localhost:3000`

There are no tests associated with this application as it was built quickly for demonstration purposes. All production code should be covered by tests to prevent regression, but failures in application have little to no cost.
